#Introduction to Geospatial Development

This is a brief introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for 
undergraduate students in computer science. It covers what I think are the 
essentials one should know when working with spatial data: 

1. data types
2. scale
3. projections

After a brief survey of these topics, a few reasons for why computer science
students may want to learn about GIS are presented. Finally, we'll make a 
simple web map application using Python, Leaflet, and the Yelp API.
